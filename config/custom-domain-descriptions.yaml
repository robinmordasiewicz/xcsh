    source_patterns_hash: "62899679c74cb3b2"
    short: "Configure session credentials and environment profiles"
    medium: >-
      Set up authentication tokens, organize named profiles for multiple tenants,
      and switch between target environments for CLI operations.
    long: >-
      Control authentication and session state across multiple environments.
      Run 'show' to display current connection details and token status.
      Organize credentials with 'profile' to maintain separate configurations
      for development, staging, and production tenants. Switch active targets
      via 'context' without re-authenticating. Run 'banner' for visual
      confirmation of the active environment. Profiles persist locally with
      token-based and certificate authentication support.

      profile:
        short: "Manage saved connection configurations for authentication"
        medium: >-
          Store and switch between multiple tenant connection settings.
          Create, list, and activate named configurations to avoid repeated
          credential entry.
        long: >-
          Organize tenant connections as reusable named entries for rapid
          environment switching. Each entry persists URLs and authentication
          tokens, removing manual reconfiguration overhead. Available operations:
          'list' enumerates saved entries, 'show' reveals configuration details,
          'create' registers new connections, 'delete' purges obsolete ones,
          'active' identifies the current selection, and 'use' changes context.
          Ideal for workflows spanning development, staging, and production tiers.
      context:
        short: "Manage default namespace for scoping operations"
        medium: >-
          Configure and display the active namespace used to scope commands.
          Set, view, or list available namespaces for your session.
        long: >-
          Control which namespace subsequent operations target by default.
          Namespaces partition resources and configurations, ensuring commands
          affect only the intended area. Use 'show' to display the current
          selection, 'set' to switch contexts, and 'list' to enumerate
          accessible options. Once configured, the choice persists across
          commands until explicitly changed, eliminating repeated namespace
          flag usage.

  cloudstatus:
    source_patterns_hash: "4740377a4bac0565"
    short: "Check infrastructure health and active incidents"
    medium: >-
      Query service availability, component health, ongoing incidents, and
      scheduled maintenance windows across infrastructure regions.
    long: >-
      Display real-time operational state for infrastructure components and
      services. Track ongoing incidents with severity levels and resolution
      timelines. View upcoming maintenance windows affecting particular regions
      or deployments. Filter results by component type, severity, time range,
      or operational condition. Retrieve incident history and outage
      notifications. Commands support monitoring degraded performance
      indicators and uptime metrics useful for operations teams.

    source_patterns_hash: "796a6ae0ff3bdd05"
    short: "Generate tab-assist scripts for supported shells"
    medium: >-
      Create shell scripts enabling tab-triggered suggestions for commands,
      subcommands, flags, and option values in bash, zsh, and fish.
    long: >-
      Output autocomplete functionality for your terminal environment. Bash,
      zsh, and fish are fully supported with context-aware prompts covering
      command names, nested subcommands, available flags, and valid argument
      values. Installation requires sourcing the generated content in your
      shell's configuration file (.bashrc, .zshrc, or config.fish). Execute
      the appropriate subcommand to produce the script, then follow
      shell-specific setup instructions to activate intelligent tab behavior.
