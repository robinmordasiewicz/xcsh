Example:\n\n    package google.profile;\n    message Person {\n      string first_name = 1;\n      string last_name = 2;\n    }\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\",\n      \"firstName\": <string>,\n      \"lastName\": <string>\n    }\n\nIf the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON\nrepresentation, that representation will be embedded adding a field\n`value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`\nfield. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\",\n      \"value\": \"1.212s\"\n    }","properties":{"type_url":{"type":"string","description":"A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized\nprotocol buffer message.

The name should be in a canonical form\n(e.g., leading \".\" is not accepted).\n\nIn practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they\nexpect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the\nscheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type\nserver that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:\n\n* If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.\n* An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]\n  value in binary format, or produce an error.\n* Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the\n  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any\n  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved\n  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage\n  breaking changes.)\n\nNote: this functionality is not currently available in the official\nprotobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with\ntype.googleapis.com.\n\nSchemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be\nused with implementation specific semantics."},"value":{"type":"string","description":"Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above specified type.","format":"byte"}}},"schemaErrorCode":{"type":"string","description":"Union of all possible error-codes from system\n\n - EOK: No error\n - EPERMS: Permissions error\n - EBADINPUT: Input is not correct\n - ENOTFOUND: Not found\n - EEXISTS: Already exists\n - EUNKNOWN: Unknown/catchall error\n - ESERIALIZE: Error in serializing/de-serializing\n - EINTERNAL: Server error\n - EPARTIAL: Partial error","title":"ErrorCode","enum":["EOK","EPERMS","EBADINPUT","ENOTFOUND","EEXISTS","EUNKNOWN","ESERIALIZE","EINTERNAL","EPARTIAL"],"default":"EOK","x-displayname":"Error Code","x-ves-proto-enum":"ves.io.schema.ErrorCode"},"schemaErrorType":{"type":"object","description":"Information about a error in API operation","title":"ErrorType","x-displayname":"Error Type","x-ves-proto-message":"ves.io.schema.ErrorType","properties":{"code":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/schemaErrorCode"},"error_obj":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/protobufAny"},"message":{"type":"string","description":" A human readable string of the error\n\nExample: ` \"value\"`","title":"message","x-displayname":"Message","x-ves-example":"value"}}},"schemaInterfaceOrNetwork":{"type":"object","description":"Selects an interface on a node","title":"Interface Or Network","x-displayname":"Interface Or Network","x-ves-oneof-field-interface_choice":"[\"intf\",\"pod\",\"vn\",\"vn_type\"]","x-ves-proto-message":"ves.io.schema.InterfaceOrNetwork","properties":{"intf":{"type":"string","description":"Exclusive with [pod vn vn_type]\n Name of the chosen interface on the node\n\nExample: ` \"eth0\"`\n\nValidation Rules:\n  ves.io.schema.rules.string.max_len: 256\n  ves.io.schema.rules.string.min_len: 1\n","title":"Interface Name","minLength":1,"maxLength":256,"x-displayname":"Interface Name","x-ves-example":"eth0","x-ves-validation-rules":{"ves.io.schema.rules.string.max_len":"256","ves.io.schema.rules.string.min_len":"1"}},"pod":{"type":"string","description":"Exclusive with [intf vn vn_type]\n Name of the pod whose interface on the node is chosen\n\nExample: ` \"pod-5444dcd747-868hq\"`\n\nValidation Rules:\n  ves.io.schema.rules.string.max_len: 256\n  ves.io.schema.rules.string.min_len: 1\n","title":"Pod Name","minLength":1,"maxLength":256,"x-displayname":"Pod Name","x-ves-example":"pod-5444dcd747-868hq","x-ves-validation-rules":{"ves.io.schema.rules.string.max_len":"256","ves.io.schema.rules.string.min_len":"1"}},"vn":{"type":"string","description":"Exclusive with [intf pod vn_type]\n Name of chosen Virtual Network\n\nExample: ` \"site-local-outside-vn\"`\n\nValidation Rules:\n  ves.io.schema.rules.string.max_len: 256\n  ves.io.schema.rules.string.min_len: 1\n","title":"Virtual Network","minLength":1,"maxLength":256,"x-displayname":"Virtual Network","x-ves-example":"site-local-outside-vn","x-ves-validation-rules":{"ves.io.schema.rules.string.max_len":"256","ves.io.schema.rules.string.min_len":"1"}},"vn_type":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/schemaVirtualNetworkType"}}},"schemaVirtualNetworkType":{"type":"string","description":"Different types of virtual networks understood by the system\n\nVirtual-network of type VIRTUAL_NETWORK_SITE_LOCAL provides connectivity to public (outside) network.\nThis is an insecure network and is connected to public internet via NAT Gateways/firwalls\nVirtual-network of this type is local to every site.
