This means reflexive and transitive relation are *NOT* supported or\nsuch assumptions cannot be made.\n  Reflexive - tenant A (OT) -> tenant B (MT) ==> Tenant B manage Tenant A\n  Transitive - tenant A (OT) -> tenant B (MT) , tenant B (OT) -> tenant C (MT) ==> Tenant A manage Tenant C\n\nWhile creating a managed_tenant configuration object, admin can choose existing\nuser group instance from the tenant and map it to groups in the managed tenant by specifying\nmanaged tenant's group names. User in original tenant needs to be member of group specified in managed_tenant\nconfiguration. Access into managed tenant will be granted once admin of managed tenant creates an allowed tenant\nconfiguration including one or more groups specified in managed_tenant configuration.\nUntil admin of an MT creates corresponding allowed_tenant configuration, RBAC will deny access.\n\nWhen User from OT tries to access managed tenant, group memberships will be taken from OT and\ncorresponding groups will be identified via the map configuration; and underlying roles for each\nmapped group will be looked up from managed_tenant (MT) and evaluated for the API access.\n\nThis gives admin of managed tenant ability to have granular RBAC(Role Based Access Control) for all\nuser access from original tenant and admin of original tenant to control which user has access into\nwhich managed tenant based on group assignment/membership.\n\nThis feature may not be enabled by default and will require subscribing to additional addon service\n`Tenant Manangement` depending upon the tenant's plan","version":""},"paths":{"/api/web/namespaces/system/managed_client/customer_supports":{"get":{"summary":"List tickets of managed tenant","description":"Returns list of customer support tickets of managed tenant","operationId":"ves.io.schema.tenant_management.managed_tenant.CustomerSupportCustomAPI.List","responses":{"200":{"description":"A successful response.","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/tenant_managementListSupportTicketResponse"}}}},"401":{"description":"Returned when operation is not authorized","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"format":"string"}}}},"403":{"description":"Returned when there is no permission to access resource","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"format":"string"}}}},"404":{"description":"Returned when resource is not found","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"format":"string"}}}},"409":{"description":"Returned when operation on resource is conflicting with current value","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"format":"string"}}}},"429":{"description":"Returned when operation has been rejected as it is happening too frequently","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"format":"string"}}}},"500":{"description":"Returned when server encountered an error in processing API","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"format":"string"}}}},"503":{"description":"Returned when service is unavailable temporarily","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"format":"string"}}}},"504":{"description":"Returned when server timed out processing request","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"format":"string"}}}}},"externalDocs":{"description":"Examples of this operation","url":"https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs-v2/platform/reference/api-ref/ves-io-schema-tenant_management-managed_tenant-customersupportcustomapi-list"},"x-ves-proto-rpc":"ves.io.schema.tenant_management.managed_tenant.CustomerSupportCustomAPI.List"},"post":{"summary":"Create customer support ticket in managed tenant","description":"Creates a new customer support ticket in our customer support provider system.","operationId":"ves.io.schema.tenant_management.managed_tenant.CustomerSupportCustomAPI.Create","responses":{"200":{"description":"A successful response.","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/schemacustomer_supportCreateResponse"}}}},"401":{"description":"Returned when operation is not authorized","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"format":"string"}}}},"403":{"description":"Returned when there is no permission to access resource","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"format":"string"}}}},"404":{"description":"Returned when resource is not found","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"format":"string"}}}},"409":{"description":"Returned when operation on resource is conflicting with current value","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"format":"string"}}}},"429":{"description":"Returned when operation has been rejected as it is happening too frequently","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"format":"string"}}}},"500":{"description":"Returned when server encountered an error in processing API","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"format":"string"}}}},"503":{"description":"Returned when service is unavailable temporarily","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"format":"string"}}}},"504":{"description":"Returned when server timed out processing request","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"format":"string"}}}}},"requestBody":{"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/schemacustomer_supportCreateRequest"}}},"required":true},"externalDocs":{"description":"Examples of this operation","url":"https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs-v2/platform/reference/api-ref/ves-io-schema-tenant_management-managed_tenant-customersupportcustomapi-create"},"x-ves-proto-rpc":"ves.io.schema.tenant_management.managed_tenant.CustomerSupportCustomAPI.Create"},"x-displayname":"Managed Tenant","x-ves-proto-service":"ves.io.schema.tenant_management.managed_tenant.CustomerSupportCustomAPI","x-ves-proto-service-type":"CUSTOM_PUBLIC"},"/api/web/namespaces/system/managed_client/customer_supports/{tp_id}":{"get":{"summary":"Get customer support ticket in managed tenant","description":"Support ticket representation we display to customers.

contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a\nURL that describes the type of the serialized message.\n\nProtobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form\nof utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.\n\nExample 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.\n\n    Foo foo = ...;\n    Any any;\n    any.PackFrom(foo);\n    ...\n    if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {\n      ...\n    }\n\nExample 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.\n\n    Foo foo = ...;\n    Any any = Any.pack(foo);\n    ...\n    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {\n      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);\n    }\n\n Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.\n\n    foo = Foo(...)\n    any = Any()\n    any.Pack(foo)\n    ...\n    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):\n      any.Unpack(foo)\n      ...\n\n Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go\n\n     foo := &pb.Foo{...}\n     any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)\n     ...\n     foo := &pb.Foo{}\n     if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {\n       ...\n     }\n\nThe pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use\n'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack\nmethods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'\nin the type URL, for example \"foo.bar.com/x/y.z\" will yield type\nname \"y.z\".\n\n\nJSON\n====\nThe JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular\nrepresentation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an\nadditional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:\n\n    package google.profile;\n    message Person {\n      string first_name = 1;\n      string last_name = 2;\n    }\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\",\n      \"firstName\": <string>,\n      \"lastName\": <string>\n    }\n\nIf the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON\nrepresentation, that representation will be embedded adding a field\n`value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`\nfield. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\",\n      \"value\": \"1.212s\"\n    }","properties":{"type_url":{"type":"string","description":"A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized\nprotocol buffer message. This string must contain at least\none \"/\" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent\nthe fully qualified name of the type (as in\n`path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form\n(e.g., leading \".\" is not accepted).\n\nIn practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they\nexpect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the\nscheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type\nserver that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:\n\n* If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.\n* An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]\n  value in binary format, or produce an error.\n* Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the\n  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any\n  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved\n  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage\n  breaking changes.)\n\nNote: this functionality is not currently available in the official\nprotobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with\ntype.googleapis.com.\n\nSchemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be\nused with implementation specific semantics."},"value":{"type":"string","description":"Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above specified type.","format":"byte"}}},"schemaConditionType":{"type":"object","description":"Conditions are used in the object status to describe the current state of the\nobject, e.g. Ready, Succeeded, etc.","title":"ConditionType","x-displayname":"Status Condition","x-ves-proto-message":"ves.io.schema.ConditionType","properties":{"hostname":{"type":"string","description":" Hostname of the instance of the site that sent the status","title":"hostname","x-displayname":"Hostname"},"last_update_time":{"type":"string","description":" Last time the condition was updated","title":"last_update_time","format":"date-time","x-displayname":"Last Updated"},"reason":{"type":"string","description":" x-reason: \"Insufficient memory in data plane\"\n A human readable string explaining the reason for reaching this condition\n\nExample: ` \"value\"`","title":"reason","x-displayname":"Reason","x-ves-example":"value"},"service_name":{"type":"string","description":" Name of the service that sent the status","title":"service name","x-displayname":"Service Name"},"status":{"type":"string","description":" Status of the condition\n \"Success\" Validtion has succeded.
