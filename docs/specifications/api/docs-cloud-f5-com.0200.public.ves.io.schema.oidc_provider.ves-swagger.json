It is required that the OIDC provider application that will \nbe integrated must have the support enabled for Authorization Code flow as defined by the specification.\n\nBefore proceeding, admin needs to have access to organization's authentication application\nor has permission to create a new one. Create API require entering details of well-known\nOpenID configuration of authentication application and once successful creation, admin should\nenable the redirect URL provided by volterra identity in application's allowed list of URLs. \nMore details of this can be found under create request/response.\n\nWith OIDC provider configured, admin of a tenant can make use of Single Sign On (SSO)\nfunctionality for users to access F5XC service using same email address and admin has the\nflexibility to re-use the authentication/identity provider that may be already using \nwithin their organization. Once SSO is enabled, except tenant admin (owner) all users in the tenant \nwill be converted to SSO user and will lose existing email/password login created with Volterra\nand can only use SSO to login.","version":""},"paths":{"/api/web/custom/namespaces/{namespace}/oidc_provider/{name}":{"get":{"summary":"Get","description":"Get implements oidc provider query by name.\nReturns oidc provider object.

Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\",\n      \"value\": \"1.212s\"\n    }","properties":{"type_url":{"type":"string","description":"A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized\nprotocol buffer message.

Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved\n  on changes to types.
